            "ANGEL'S WHISPER" is an upcoming AI-driven Web3 romance development
            game from the BitCast team. It features a unique Web3 gameplay where
            each choice in the game represents a vote. This voting system is
            used to reshape and extend the narratives and characters, driven by
            the Generative AI and our community.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6 font-sans lg:w-[80%] lg:left-16 relative">
            Revenue generated from the reshaped game is distributed among early
            players. This introduces a new GameFi token economy system,
            encapsulating a Play-to-Build-to-Earn model.

          <h1>HOW TO PLAY THE DEMO?</h1>
          <p>
            1. Each girl has a unique personality and preferences. Try to
            converse with and understand her.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Above the dialogue box, the AI will calculate 'Love Points' based
            on each interaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. When 'Love Points' reach 30, the AI will give you a passcode. (If
            no passcode appears, it means the girl isn't satisfied with your
            performance, and you need to accumulate Love Points again.)
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Collect 3 different passcodes to redeem the ANGEL'S WHISPER OG WL
            on the website
